3. Connect your device via USB once to authorize the connection
4. Run the `device.bat` script to establish a wireless ADB connection
5. Now you can use mobile features like calls and SMS

## Database Configuration

The system uses SQLite to store:

1. **System Commands**: Applications that can be opened
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO sys_command VALUES (null, 'app_name', 'C:\path\to\application.exe');
   ```

2. **Web Commands**: Websites that can be opened
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO web_command VALUES (null, 'website_name', 'https://website.com');
   ```

3. **Contacts**: People you can message or call
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO contacts VALUES (null, 'contact_name', 'phone_number', 'email');
   ```

## Customization

- Change the assistant name in `engine/config.py`
- Modify UI elements in the HTML/CSS files
- Add new commands by extending the `allCommands` function in `engine/command.py`

## Troubleshooting

- **Face Authentication Issues**: Make sure you have good lighting and your face is clearly visible
- **Voice Recognition Problems**: Check your microphone settings and speak clearly
- **Mobile Connection Issues**: Run `device.bat` again to reconnect to your device
- **Application Not Opening**: Verify the path in the database is correct
